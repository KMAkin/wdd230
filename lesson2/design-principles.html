                Cassie's site does a great job of using the white space and clean design principle. She makes sure 
                that the page is not cluttered and is appealing to the eye. She balanced the design between all 
                the elements so that her message could be communicated to the visitors.

            <p>
                Schultz Outfitters used the visual hieratchy principle. The first thing I notice is them trying to
                show how amazing it looks when out in the woods or desert. However, their main vocus was around 
                ensuring the vistor knew how to get a hold of someone from their company so they could start 
                planning a hunt using them.

                Groupon is using the Fitt's Law principle. They make it so the visitor is not having to hunt the 
                page(s) trying to find what they are looking for. They place big buttons to help narrow the search 
                of the item(s) the visitor is looking for.
